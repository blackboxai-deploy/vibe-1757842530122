- [x] Update package.json with all necessary dependencies
- [x] Configure TypeScript and ESLint settings

### Phase 2: Database Configuration & Types
- [x] Create Supabase database schema and migration files
- [x] Set up database types and interfaces
- [x] Configure Row Level Security policies
- [x] Create seed data for initial setup

### Phase 3: Authentication System
- [x] Set up Supabase Auth configuration
- [x] Create authentication components (Login, Register)
- [x] Implement middleware for route protection
- [x] Create user session management

### Phase 4: Core Layout & Navigation
- [x] Create root layout with authentication
- [x] Build responsive navigation header
- [x] Implement landing/dashboard page
- [x] Set up routing structure

### Phase 5: Chat Interface
- [x] Build main chat interface components
- [x] Create message display and input components
- [x] Implement real-time chat functionality
- [x] Add SQL result display components

### Phase 6: OpenAI Integration
- [x] Set up OpenAI API client
- [x] Create chat API endpoint with streaming
- [x] Implement conversation context management
- [x] Add SQL query generation capabilities

### Phase 7: Invoice Upload System
- [x] Create file upload interface with drag & drop
- [x] Implement secure file validation
- [x] Set up Supabase Storage integration
- [x] Build invoice management dashboard

### Phase 8: Database Integration
